    "## Prompt Basics\n",
    "Prompting is the methodology through which we communicate instructions, parameters, and expectations to large language models. Consider a prompt as a detailed specification document provided to the model: the more precise and comprehensive the specifications, the higher the quality of the output. This guide establishes the fundamental principles for crafting effective prompts for open-source instruction-tuned models, including Llama, Deepseek, and Gemma."

    "(Sustainability related?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching is a technique used for optimizing both performance and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind it, is: if you send a large prompt (for example, a long system message, context, or background document), you shouldn’t have to pay for it repeatedly or retransmit it fully on every API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the concept of prompt caching is implemented in groq:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model prompts often contain repetitive content, such as system prompts and tool definitions. Prompt caching automatically reuses computation from recent requests when they share a common prefix, delivering significant cost savings and improved response times while maintaining data privacy through volatile-only storage that expires automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching works automatically on all your API requests with no code changes required and no additional fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works\n",
    "Prefix Matching: When you send a request, the system examines and identifies matching prefixes from recently processed requests stored temporarily in volatile memory. Prefixes can include system prompts, tool definitions, few-shot examples, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache Hit: If a matching prefix is found, cached computation is reused, dramatically reducing latency and token costs by 50% for cached portions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache Miss: If no match exists, your prompt is processed normally, with the prefix temporarily cached for potential future matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Expiration: All cached data automatically expires within a few hours, which helps ensure privacy while maintaining the benefits."
