      "Okay, the user asked, \"Why is the sky blue?\" I need to explain this in a clear and accurate way. Let me start by recalling what I know about this. The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, sunlight is white, but it's made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, the molecules and small particles in the air scatter the light. Shorter wavelengths like blue and violet are scattered more than longer ones like red and yellow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, why blue and not violet? Oh, right, the sun emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. So the scattered blue light reaches our eyes, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I should mention that during sunrise or sunset, the sky turns red or orange. That's because the light has to pass through more atmosphere, so the shorter wavelengths are scattered away, leaving the longer ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure to explain Rayleigh scattering and the role of the atmosphere's composition. Maybe mention that the particles in the air are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, which is why the scattering is more effective for shorter wavelengths. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, clarify that the sky isn't actually blue but the color we perceive is due to the scattered light. Maybe touch on the fact that without an atmosphere, like on the moon, the sky would be black. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to structure this in a logical flow: start with sunlight, explain scattering, mention the wavelengths, the role of human eyes, and then the exceptions like sunrise/sunset. Keep it simple and avoid too much jargon. Check if there's any common misconceptions to address, like the sky being blue because of water vapor or something else. No, it's mainly due to air molecules. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight is a mix of all visible colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), each with different wavelengths (shorter for blue/violet, longer for red/orange).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scattering in the Atmosphere**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles (like nitrogen and oxygen). These scatter the light in all directions. **Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet)** are scattered more intensely than longer wavelengths (red, orange).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Why Blue, Not Violet?**  \n",
      "   - The sun emits more blue light than violet.  \n",
      "   - Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light.  \n",
      "   - Some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, reducing its contribution.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Result**: The scattered blue light fills the sky, making it appear blue to us. This scattering occurs in all directions, so the sky looks blue from any point in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Exceptions**:  \n",
      "   - **Sunrise/Sunset**: During these times, sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering out most blue light. The remaining red/orange wavelengths dominate, creating the warm hues.  \n",
      "   - **No Atmosphere**: On the Moon or in space, the sky appears black because there are no molecules to scatter sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the blue sky is a result of how Earth's atmosphere interacts with sunlight, scattering blue light more than other colorsâ€”and our eyes perceiving that scattered light. ðŸŒŠâœ¨\n",
